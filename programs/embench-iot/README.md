# Embench&#x2122;: Open Benchmarks for Embedded Platforms

This repository contains the Embench&#x2122; free and open source benchmark
suite.  These benchmarks are designed to test the performance of deeply
embedded systems.  As such they assume the presence of no OS, minimal C
library support and in particular no output stream.

The rationale behind this benchmark is described in "Embenchâ„¢: An Evolving
Benchmark Suite for Embedded IoT Computers from an Academic-Industrial
Cooperative: Towards the Long Overdue and Deserved Demise of Dhrystone" by David
Patterson, Jeremy Bennett, Palmer Dabbelt, Cesare Garlati, G. S. Madhusudan
and Trevor Mudge (see https://tmt.knect365.com/risc-v-workshop-zurich/agenda/2#software_embench-tm-a-free-benchmark-suite-for-embedded-computing-from-an-academic-industry-cooperative-towards-the-long-overdue-and-deserved-demise-of-dhrystone).

The benchmarks are largely derived from the Bristol/Embecosm Embedded
Benchmark Suite (BEEBS, see https://beebs.mageec.org/), which in turn draws
its material from various earlier projects.  A full description and user
manual is in the [`doc` directory](./doc/README.md).
